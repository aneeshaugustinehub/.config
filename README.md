# Hyprland Configuration for Arch Linux

This repository contains my personalized Hyprland configuration for Arch Linux. Hyprland is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor known for its performance and aesthetics. This config is tailored for productivity and a clean, minimalistic desktop experience.

## Features

- **Keybindings**: Custom keybindings for window management, application launching, and workspace navigation.
- **Aesthetics**: Configured with a consistent theme, including status bars, wallpapers, and transparency effects.
- **Scripts**: Custom scripts for system controls (e.g., brightness, volume) and automation.
- **Applications**: Integration with tools like `waybar`, `rofi`, and `dunst` for a cohesive workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Arch Linux (up-to-date)
- Hyprland installed (`pacman -S hyprland`)
- Wayland-compatible applications (e.g., `waybar`, `rofi`, `dunst`)
- Optional: `yay` or another AUR helper for additional packages
